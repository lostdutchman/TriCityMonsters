mori "Alright, so you're not scared."
pov "Of you?  Not so much.  Of demons pretending to be cops and trying to harvest people for some... nefarious purpose?  Some bigger, nebulous bad thing turning people into demons?  Maybe."
"Mori thinks about this for a second and then nods."
mori "I'm not super proud of what I am so it... it's nice to know I'm not as horrifying as it feels to turn into that thing."
pov "You were a {i}little{/i} scary.  But you've been consistently trustworthy so far... so past the shock?  No, I wasn't really scared."
"He slinks a little closer and leans up against the wall next to me."
mori "You're pretty tough.  And good in a little chaos."
"He leans in a little further and I think I know where this is going.  My face heats up a little before I can quite get a hold of myself but hopefully the lighting is so dim I don't give myself away."
pov "You are pushing your luck for someone who dragged me through a stampede of punks, cops, and demon cops, my dude."
"He's not particularly tall but he's definitely looming just on the edge of 'appropriate personal space' and his little shit eating grin is intense."
mori "It's hard to resist someone who sees all that and doesn't just freak out.  Besides, I wanted to make out back at Pitrats and never got the chance."
pov "So you wanna make out here?  After all that?"
mori "What d'ya think?"

"To my surprise, Mori doesn't seem hurt in the slightest."
"On the contrary, he chuckles lowly to himself and straightens up, putting a slightly more respectable distance bwetween us, and runs and hand through his hair carelessly."
mori "That's fair.  Hope you don't mind if I ask again sometime."
pov "Today was... extremely weird."
mori "Yeah.  I guess I did literally drag you into it.  My bad."
pov "Well, we both survived so I guess no harm, no foul."
mori "Ahh.  Let's get you home quick.  Keep the jacket, I'll get it back from you at my next show."
"I can't resist the bait and I bite, even if I'm rolling my eyes at his absurd confidence."
pov "When's that gonna be?"
mori "Saturday.  At the Drunk Tank."
"I nod, laughing slightly."
pov "Alirght I'll be there."
