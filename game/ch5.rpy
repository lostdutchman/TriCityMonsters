mori "Come on."
pov "There's no fire escape, though, you don't think it's a good idea to go back down into Pitrats, do you?"

mori "Oh {i}noooo{/i}, definitely not.  This whole area is no good.  Those things never travel alone."

"I stop dead in my tracks."

pov "What?"

mori "There's more of them around here, that's why we gotta leave."

"To his credit he sounds marginally more urgent, though not nearly enough, in my opinion."
"He pulls me to the ledge and I immediately feel a wash of vertigo overtake me for a second as I stare down into the alley below us."

pov "I already said, there's no-"

mori "It's on the other building."

"He jerks his jaw and I follow the careless gesture."
"Across the way, on the opposite building, a rusty fire escape is bolted into the brick."

pov "Yeah that's a fire escape all right."
pov "{i}Too bad it's on the other building!{/i}"

mori "I can jump it."

pov "No you can't, that's like fifteen feet and we're five storeys up!  And you think you're gonna make that holding me or something!?"

"I watch him open his mouth to argue but the humor leaves his eyes in an instant and his whole demeanor shifts to something alarmed."

mori "[povname]!!"

"Stupidly, I look down at what's got him looking suddenly afraid instead of recoiling away at his warning."

"There's another horrifying shape rushing up at us, claws gouging into the wall beneath my feet as clambers up towards me at a horrifying speed."
"It hits me with the force of a speeding car and my feet leave the ground.  My guts drop but it all happens so fast I just can't react, even as the sky and Mori's ashen face wheel dizzyingly."
"Something stops my fall before I hit the rooftop again and I blink numbly, watching my feet dangle maybe fifteen or so feet above the concrete."
"And then my brain kicks into gear and my insides are a cascade of ice."
"I'm being held up like a broken toy by another twisted, grotesque shape.  Claws are gripping me tight, tight enough to puncture"
"The smell of sulfur and the wisps of steam are choking me and a painful gag makes my body spasm in its huge clawed grasp."
"Worst of all... I can tell almost immediately that this one is {i}not{/i} the same one as before..."
"Its features are just as repulsive but they're different..."

thing "You are trying our patience, Contractbound."

mori "Put [them!t] down or I'll eviscerate you!"

thing "Arrogant."

"It makes a wheezy sound that takes me a second to realize it's a laugh, all the while its claws tighten in my shoulder like knives."
"I'm trying desperately not to pass out from both pain and terror and man, that's really put to the test in the next instant."
"Several more monsters emerge from around the rooftop and the sight of three of these twisted monstrosities is really putting a strain on my ability to stay rational."
"Mori stands there, braced like he's gonna square up against these things and looking distinctly rebellious at the taunt."
"He's not running."
"Why isn't he running?"
"No one can save us.  This is it, this is how I'm gonna die."
"The world is a fucked up place."

####SFX

"Mori moves suddenly, doubling over and nearly dropping to his knees.  I didn't see him take a hit and I frantically try to discern if he's been wounded-"
"But when he rights himself...  He's not {i}Mori{/i} anymore."

"Something large... catlike but bipedal stands in his place, something with huge, heavy shoulders and thick fur.  Something haloed by streaks of blue fire."

pov "What the {i}fuck{/i}...?"

"A deep, visceral growl rips up his throat and he lunges."
"He charges the demon holding me over the ground and moves much too fast to be stopped in time.  He crashes into it in a flurry of claws and teeth, huge split tails thrashing and ears flattened back against his skull."
"The reactionary movement in the demon tearing my shoulder up is violent and without warning, I'm flung sideways."

"My mouth opens to scream but just like in a nightmare, nothing past a weak gasp issues out of my mouth."
