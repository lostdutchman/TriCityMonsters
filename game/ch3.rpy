"Without a word, he pulls me along with him him, his palm sliding down my arm to grab my hand."
"It's sweaty..."
"Not the most pleasant thing in the world, honestly, but I can't deny that I do feel a lot better with someone looking out for me."
"Ahead of him I can make out the tall, thick figure of the vocalist and the rest of the band, moving with purpose towards the exit."
"... and then I realize something."

"The cops are almost entirely focused on getting people out of the way so they can get to the band."
"Actually, there's wild gesticulating and I can see the nearest cop's mouth move.  I can't make out his words over the noise but he's looking right at {i}Mori{/i}."
"And now me, who he's dragging along bodily."

mori "Stay with me, you go down in a crowd like this you'll get hurt!"
mori "Just like Black Friday CCTV footage!"

"He nimbly sidesteps to the right, avoiding a {i}very{/i} aggravated looking officer by only a scant few inches, hauling me along like I weigh nothing."
"Mori cackles loudly, looking- impossibly- delighted and 99% unconcerned with the situation at large."
"But he's caught up in the momentary victory... and doesn't see the next cop lunging at us from the side."

pov "Watch out!"
"I pull back suddenly, reaffirming my grip on his hand, and yank his arm to keep him from charging directly into them."

mori "hehehh"
mori "Thanks!  I didn't even see him!"

"He spares a second to smirk widely at me.  He's actually, {i}really{/i} enjoying this, isn't he?"
"The cop recovers and makes to lunge again but Mori- without an iota of hesitation- shoulder checks him roughly and lets out another loud crow of laughter even as the cop sags, winded and bruised."
"Okay, no, this really is fun for him."

pov "They're gonna toss you straight in jail when they catch you!"

mori "Ha, they gotta catch me first."

"His smile is huge an earnest and there's a chaotic glint to his eyes that is, admittedly, a little adrenalizing to see."
"At the staircase there's a solid wall of bottlenecked people and- without slowing at all- Mori suddenly veers to the left, moving away from his bandmates and pulling me with him."
"He dodges around sound equipment and the plastic drink table with ease while I stagger along in his wake.  He lets go of my hand to throw his shoulder against a huge amp in the corner."
"With a slight grunt, it shifts and reveals a small metal ladder bolted into the concrete wall."
"A fire escape."
"I follow it up with my eyes towards a dusty ceiling hatch, leading to the floors above."

mori "Up. Hurry."

"Obliging, I launch up as quick as I can.  The metal warps slightly beneath me, especially once Mori climbs up beneathe me.  I reach the hatch without issue and yank on the ancient, grime-coated release lever."
"But it won't budge."
"The scene below is still utter chaos and I can feel panicked sweat start to break out on my forehead as several furious cops point out our location to more fighting their way down from the alley entrance."
"I yank as hard as I can, I can feel the latch digging painfully deep into the meat of my palm...!"
"But it won't move."

"Mori pulls himself up a few more rungs and presses me against the ladder, stretching to reach over me and grab the release, his tattooed hand closing over mine."
"He jerks it open with apparent ease on the first try, though it showers us with dust as he shoves it open with a low chuckle."

mori "Keep climbing to the roof, they'll be swarming the streets."
pov "What about your bandmates?  They were headed towards the main entrance!"
