"Mori's suddenly tense, watching the ledge to our left with a disconcerting kind of intensity."
 
"Instantly, something cold grips my guts.  On stage and running in the chaos below, he'd been all fun and games but now..."
"I can tell by his posture alone that something serious is up."
mori "..."
"I follow his gaze to try and anticipate the problem and for a moment, I don't see anything."
"But then I realize that there's a column of steam rising in a weirdly narrow band, growing thicker and denser by the second."
pov "I have a bad feeling about this..."

mori "Hey..."
"His voice is low and tense, eyes locked unblinkingly at the half opaque billow of steam."
mori "Do me a favor and stay behind me, okay?"
mori "No matter what you see."
pov "What does THAT mean??"
"Mori gives a bitter sounding-laugh."
mori "Sorry, no time right now.  Maybe later.  But stay back, alright?  Cover your eyes."
mori "I can handle this but you definitely can't."
"OKAY well that's ominous as hell but I don't have time to say much."

"There's a horrible grating sound coming from the building ledge and before my eyes can focus on the newest danger, the wind shifts and the smell hits me like a wall."
"It's {i}fetid{/i}."
"Like wet, rotting eggs.  Like sulfur."
"My eyes water almost instantly as the putrid steam billows thicker, passing over Mori and I like a rancid cloud."
"But then I catch the tense ripple up Mori and follow his intense stare back towards the pigeon-shit-speckled ledge."
"A thrill of horror drops through my guts and I'm absolutely {i}paralyzed{/i}."

"There's a person."
"A cop.  Clawing their way onto the roof."
"The sulfuric fog is rising off them in visible, yellowish wafts and the flashing lights from the police cars below cast its twisted features into stark, horrifying contrast."
"It's not a cop, it's not a person..."
"I gasp before I can stop myself and Mori adjusts the way his feet are braced so he's firmly in front of me."
"Whatever this thing is... it clawed its way up a five-story building on its own power."

"As it jerkily pulls itself up over the ledge I can feel my brain straining to classify it."
"It's humanish in general shape but distorted to monstrous proportions.  Pale, twisted limbs stretch out at gangling angles, and it moves sideways like a crab."
"The police uniform that once fit this thing's gnarled body hanging off it in tatters, unable to contain the horrible limbs and size of it."
"Long digits curve into claws sharp enough to gouge brick and its slack, vertically slit maw is a horrorshow of teeth like some kind of demonic lamprey..."
"A low, rattling hiss issues from it with its ragged breaths, along with a quanity of black, ropey saliva."

mori "Ugh..."

"I can feel a scream rising up my chest but it catches in my throat and I can't... I can't do anything..."
"This can't be real...  It can't be..."
"The twisted, mangled mess of limbs crawls up onto the rooftop sideways and skittery.  It's huge too, stretched out and so malformed my brain feels like it's shorting out just looking at it."

mori "Hey."
mori "Breathe.  You'll pass out."

"{i}Damn{/i}, his voice is jarringly calm... even if he doesn't turn his eyes away from the horror or uncoil."
"The thing takes a deep breath and then..."

thing "{size=50}You're a cocky little shit.{/size}"

pov "Holy shit it talked-!"

mori "Quiet!"

thing "{size=50}Pay attention to what's in front of you, boy.{/size}"
thing "{size=50}Dont expect me to let you walk away after making me chase you down.{/size}"

mori "Get fucked."
mori "You turn this into a fight and you won't walk off what I do to you."

thing "{size=50}You owe a debt!{/size}"
thing "{size=50}You signed a contract!{/size}"
thing "{size=50}You have not delivered!!{/size}"

"The thing's melting, dripping face angles for a second and it makes a noise like a huge dog sniffing tentatively."
"It shifts slightly and- recognizable facial features or no- I can tell it's staring at me."
"Honestly, I have no idea how I keep from fainting on the spot.  My heart feels like it's about to explode."

thing "{size=50}Unless that's supposed to be your idea of payment.{/size}"
mori "[they!t!c] [are!t] absolutely not.  So fuck off."

thing "{size=50}Always so confident.  It's misplaced.{/size}"
thing "{size=50}But I'm not going back empty handed today.{/size}"
thing "{size=50}[they!t!c!] [are!t] a paltry offering after two years, Meatsack.{/size}"
thing "{size=50}Get your priorities straight, Contractbound.  You're not hard to find and not even Hell will wait forever.{/size}"
"The thing, whatever it is, tenses before launching straight at us. The sick nauseating terror locked in my throat intensifies and I finally do let out that scream."
"I can't react fast enough.  My eyes are locked onto the pinpricks of ember-red set in its face where human eyes once sat."
"In that instant, I know what it feels like to be a helpless prey animal-"
"Then something hits my legs and I go down."

"Noises that I can't identify sound off all around me and I have no idea what's going on."
"There's a grunt that sounds like Mori, scrapes against the pavement-"
"The sound of something wet splattering on a solid surface..."

"I've faceplanted on the ground and I struggle to get back up.  My knee's scraped up but its superficial."
"I struggle to pull myself up as quick as I can, my vision still reeling from the instant of confusion."
"Shaky with adrenaline, I manage to get up and and regain my bearings just in time to see a bright flash of light."
"Like a column of fire it ignites the rooftop."

"For just a second, something hulking and large is silouetted against the glare."
"Something different then the stretched out demon... something hairy and heavy, but fast and very quiet-"
"But then the light fades and the rooftop is thrown into relative shadow again."

"The city refocuses in front of me in the next instant, lights like a small starfield popping back into existence just past the dark ledge."

mori "Shit."

"He grabs my shoulders and helps me regain my balance, peering into my face intently."

mori "You okay?  You hit the ground a little hard..."
mori "Here."

"Something's placed on my shoulders.  Something heavy that smells like... cheap detergent and body heat."
"It's Mori's jacket, heavy with patches and studs but now that I've actually been offered warmth I realize I was freezing."
"And shaking, actually.  Like a leaf."

mori "Like a trauma blanket, right?"

"He laughs lowly."

pov "Yeah I am {i}definitely traumatized{/i}."

"I suddenly realize his hands are bloody and recoil."
