    "He pivots and leans in, kissing me the second he's been permitted. Honestly, I know he just said he wanted to make out back at Pitrats but it really feels like he was telling the truth in his actions now."
    "He's hungry but not desperate and the absolutely ludicrous amount of confidence he has is more hot than off putting.  I can't help but find it more engaging than actually arrogant."
    
    pov "... Hey.  Can you..."
    
    "Mori breaks away, looking pretty pleased with himself.  Just from the smug little line of his mouth I can tell he's very geared up to oblige me so I decide to push forward."
    "Maybe it's a little much considering we barely know each other but his recklessness is rubbing off on me."

    pov "Do you think you could... show me the cat form, the kaibyo again?"
    
    "Mori blinks once... twice... staring at me as though that was the absolute last thing he expected to hear."
    
    pov "You don't have to."
    mori "I'm not really proud of what I did so I just sorta pretend it's not there as much as I can... but uh.."
    mori "Alright..."
    pov "I'm curious, everything was so frantic earlier... I just want to get a good look at you.  You don't meet a demon every day."
    mori "If you're lucky, anyway.  Sure, but turn around for a second, the transformation isn't pretty.  Inbetween stages are... weird."
   
    "I oblige and turn around while Mori scans the street below for an instant.  Then I can hear him take several deep, ragged breaths."
    "While curiosity gnaws at me I stay firmly put.  It's an earnest request and I find myself wanting him to trust me."

    "Mori makes a noise, a low grunt and I take it as a signal to turn."
    "Immediately, I have to adjust where my eyes settle.  The figure in front of me now is significantly taller."
    "All the scant details I'd gathered from the confrontation in the alley sharpen into starker clarity."
    "He makes a half-hearted gesture with his thickly furred arms that has a very sarcastic {i}ta-da!{/i} feel and he averts his eyes in obvious embarrassment under the scrutiny."
    
    mori "One terminally overwarm demon form, as requested."
    
    "It's obvious he's trying to divert the gravity and awkwardness of the moment I'm still just absorbing it all."
    "His voice is much deeper like this, rough and growling even if he doesn't specifically mean to be threatening."
    "It rumbles up from the pit of his chest (that's solidly eye-level now) and there's flashes of white canines when he talks."
    "His comment makes me realize that he must indeed be constantly hot.  He's so thickly furred he looks geared to survive in total comfort in somewhere inhospitably cold."
    "I can't help but reach out and touch him."
    "And I'm surprised when he starts at the contact.  But then the tension passes and he stays still..."
    "Though, he does look away and even if his features are harder to read like this he definitely looks self conscious."
    "His fur is {i}thick{/i} and he feels like a furnace when I my fingers comb through down to his skin.  I'm struck by how much this feels like petting a soft, warm cat."  
    "A soft, warm, seven foot tall cat who definitely ripped apart several demonic horrors with his bare hands not long ago."
    "The temptation to speak is strong, I want to make a quip and divert some of the awkwardness..."
    "But I have Mori trapped in a rare moment of serious vulnerability and I find myself wanting to explore it without a lot of smarmy comments."
    "At least for right now."
    "I reach for his hand- easily twice the size of mine, now- and examine the thick black claws there."
    "They're retracted, partially obscured by silvery fur but pressing on the mottled pads of his palm reveals the wickedly sharp curves."
    
    mori "..."
    
    "He's definitely nervous and it's incredibly uncharacteristic on him.  But I suppose that's fair.  I wonder how many people he's let this close before."
    "Abruptly, I decide I've made him wait long enough for the make out he asked for."
    "I pull him in a little and step so that I'm between him and the wall of the building."
    "Honestly, I expect a quip or something but to my surprise he goes with it."
    "He braces one hand against the wall near my head and leans in, the slits of his eyes dilating in the lower light as we turn away from the street in what little privacy the shadows nearer the building afford."
    "The other goes lower, first to press against my shoulder and gently flatten my back against the brick and then to slide down to my hip."
    "Something about the novelty of this, the theoretical danger... my nerves are lighting up and my heart's starting to throb at the prospects."
    "Mori's confidence is a pleasant surprise here and the lack of melodrama is making him appealing in a way I wasn't totally prepared for."
    "He hesitates for a second, staring into my face with looming, overbright eyes."
   
    mori "[povname], you're {i}sure{/i} you want this?"
    pov "You literally asked if I wanted to make out now you're getting nervous?"
    mori "Well, I didn't expect you to be into {i}this{/i}."
    pov "That doesn't sound like you at all."
    
    "He makes an indulgent noise and shrugs, apparently satisfied with that."
    "And then he leans in all the way."  
    "I'm surprised when he bypasses my mouth and goes straight for my neck, gently scraping teeth along the exposed flesh there."  
    "It makes me weak but then the accompanying hungry growl that reverberates up his throat makes my fingers curl tightly against his furry body."
    "Without direction he slots a thick thigh between mine and already the heat is stifling and I'm gasping under him."
   
    pov "I've never made out with a demon, so I don't actually know.  But it sounds pretty exciting."
   
    "He makes an indulgent noise and shrugs, apparently satisfied with that."

    "Mori leans in immediately and in the next instant his mouth is on mine.  His motions are confident (I mean, he does everything with an absurd amount of confidence)."
    "It's ridiculous but undeniably hot.  I'm still not totally sure how he does it without being offensively arrogant but here we are."
    "I'm brought back to the moment by his arms curling tight around my hips, dragging me with surprising strength and insistence into him."
    "There's nothing wrong with his technique but honestly, it's the confidence and totally evident enthusiasm that's really starting to do it for me."
    "His hands smooth down my sides while he slowly backs me into the low wall, confident mouth kissing me almost numb..."
    "When he shifts lower to suck at the juncture of my jaw and throat I gasp raggedly in surprise then flush a little at the reaction."
    "I can feel his stupid lips curl wtih smug satisfaction but, thank god, he opts to simply continue instead of draw further attention to his success in riling me up."
    
    pov "Is this how you treat all your groupies?"
   
    "I really can't help but give in to the desire to banter, he's just so {i}smug{/i} for being a scuzzy punk.  He, of course, only chuckles at the comment."
   
    mori "You think I'm good enough to get groupies?"
    pov "Nevermind."
   
    "He flashes me a smirk that really just tells me he loves the attention and is fully prepared to shamelessly bask in it."
    "Before I can protest, he grabs me by the hips and lifts me off the ground like I weigh {i}nothing{/i}, setting me down to sit on the low railing wall."
    "A half-thought occurs to me then- he must enjoy some of the benefits of being a demon even while in a human form-"
    "But of course he manages to distract me from fully considering what this might mean."
    "He leans his torso in between my knees with that smug little smirk, daring me to reprimand him, fingers tight and impatient where they still linger around my hipbones."
    "Of course I'm not going to just give him what he wants, though."
    "Okay maybe I will.  Just a little.  But only because I want it too."
    "I reach for his jaw and pull him in.  He goes willingly and our mouths meet with a degree of roughness that's exciting."
    "Mori doesn't hold anything back, ever, it seems.  And damn it is actually pretty exciting.  Now that I've touched him I can't really keep my hands off him."
    "Immediately, they're in his hair, finding a good grip to keep him in with."
    "Mori, of course, is already two steps ahead of me, pulling me into him so hard it's bordering on greedy.  It takes him a second to unstick one of his hands from my waist."
    "But then it's smoothing up my back and the hair on my neck and arms stands on end with the contact."
    "It feels good, very good, actually but a sudden thought occurs to me and I pull back with a bit of a jolt."
    
    pov "Can you reverse it?"
    mori "Buhh?"
    
    "I can't help the small laugh that makes its way past of my flushed lips."
    
    pov "You being a demon.  Have you tried to reverse it?"
    mori "There's not really a lot of demon authorities to talk to, you know?  Besides, I've spent most of the last three years avoiding them as much as possible."

    mori "Why, is the monster build not a bonus for you."
    pov "What am I supposed to do with a cat that big?"
    mori "We can always find out."
    pov "I like you just fine like this."
