I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 48, in script call
    call ch1
  File "game/ch1.rpy", line 15, in script
    prename "So.  The {i}city{/i}.  Sure, it has its problems.  Lots of them.  But one of the benefits is that there's stuff to do even late at night."
Exception: Sayer 'prename' is not defined.
